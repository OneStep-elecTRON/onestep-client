Consider you have a data set with features of people and you need to classify whether the person is male or female. Random forest is mostly used for classification purpose but you can use it for regression tasks as well. The very first step in bagging is splitting the main data set into smaller sets to feed to different models. So we split our data set of features and feed it to differnt models, which in our case are the Decision trees. These features can be anything such as the length of hair, facial features, etc. After giving few records to our first model, we perform resampling before giving records to the next model. This step is called Row sampling with replacement.This steps is also known as ",Object(r.b)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Bootstrapping"),".

To answer this we need to know about a very important property of decision trees. All decision trees have Low bias and high variance. This basically means that the model would perform very well on the training data but when it comes to testing data, it doesn't perform very well. We want our models to have low bias and low variance and hence using Random forest over a single decision tree helps a lot as it is a combination of multiple decision trees and we take the majority of the results given by these decision trees which automatically turns the high variance into low variance. Even if we change the samples in our data, suppose we change 500 entries out of 2000 entries in our features data set, it won't affcet the model as the records are anyway distributed in different manner after feature and row sampling. Hence, Random forest is preffered over Decision trees.",Object(r.b)("br",null)),Object(r.b)("p",null,"For regression tasks, the first step of bootstrapping will remain the same. After feature and row sampling and training our decision trees, when we feed in our testing data set we will get continuous values as outputs as it is a regression type problem statement.
