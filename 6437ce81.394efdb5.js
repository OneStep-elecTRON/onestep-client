The above diagram is nothing but the whole setup of how the SVM works. Let us break it down for you. The people in the above diagram are the two classes or data points. Males are one class and females are the others. The road in between is the hyperplane dividing both these classes. The Police are nothing but the support vectors. So by this we can infer that, in SVM, we need to create a hyperplane that can easily classify the different classes present in our data. The support vectors help in determining the right hyperplane and hence this tells us that we only need a subset of all the data points to determine our hyperplane which would divide our classes in the best possible way and the behaviour of rest of the points won't affect it. These support vectors would remain closest to the border and the rest of points can be at any distance. Also, there must be some distance between our marching band and the police. This distance is known as the Margin."),Object(o.b)("p",{align:"center"},Object(o.b)("img",{src:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OneStep-elecTRON/ContentSection/main/SVM/SVM-2.png",alt:"drawing",width:"700"})),Object(o.b)("p",null,"The goal is to maximixe the margin by making least error. In regards with the above example, the goal is to prevent maximum people from going close to the marching band and also increasing the distance between the band and the police. To understand this algorithm even better, we suggest you take a look at the Math section as well which will walk you through all the required maths. We also have the concept of linear and non-linear decision boundaries. In some cases you might enocunter a data which is not linearly seperable and in order to solve these problems, we make use of Kernel Trick. This helps in transforming the already existing fetaures in order to create new features in order to seperate them. This is a much more advanced topic and you can find more about it in the advanced section."),Object(o.b)("p",null,"SVMs are preffered over some other classification models because they generate very accurate results even if the data is not linearly seperable.
